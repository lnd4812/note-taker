# Title

Note-Taker-On-The-Go

## Description

Create a browser based note saver and/or planner program using node.js and express.js to connect front-end and back-end coding.  The program enables a user to enter a Note title and text at the front end where, when the save icon is clicked, employs a POST Request to save the note, with a random genrated id, to an array of notes saved in a json file on the server.

## Installation

type in "npm start" to run a version at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) or launch on [Heroku](https://note-taker-at-work.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage

Project provides user with an online platform, accessible from any browser and/or device to save notes, appointments, reminders, etc. on the go rather than being tied to a physical note pad). A sample of how the project should appear if functioning properly was included in the [Module 11 Challenge Assignment outline](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1181/assignments/23354?module_item_id=463836), showing both the page as it appears when accessed, a list of saved notes on the left and a text area for entering notes on the ![right](public/assets/images/module-11-assignment-mock-up.png) and a version of it highlighting a ![selected note](public/assets/images/module-11-mock-up-pg-2.png) being shown in the Note input section.

## Future enhancements

I have not included functionality for showing a selected note in the Note Entry field or enabled the Write icon at the top of the page, but hope to be able to reattempt it when I have a better idea of how to do it.  The same applies to deleting entries.  I think I may be on the right track, but not quite there yet and would like to address other o/s items first.
